# Trivia Web by Saku
A simple trivia game I made in 2019.

You can go through 5 multiple choice questions and see how many you get right.
There aren't any other modes in this game as of right now.

All questions are pulled from [The Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) by PixelTail Games. Used under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
